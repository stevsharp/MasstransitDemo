# Sample Request/Response

This sample demonstrates how to build a controller using ASP.NET Core and a complementary .NET Core Console application to send a request from a controller, which is handled by the console application.

Everything is async, marvelous, and built entirely on a Mac using JetBrains Rider.

Should just be able to go into the appropriate folders and `dotnet run` each project.

RabbitMQ should be running on your Mac, using the default port and the _guest_ user account, otherwise you'll need to make changes.

Enjoy!
